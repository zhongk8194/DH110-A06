# Assignment #06: Interface Design

<br><br>

## Overview
**Project Description** <br>
My project is a redesign of the CNN.com website through the addition of features to help users more easily consume news. Specifically, like many news websites, CNN.com is hard to navigate because of the overwhelming amount of content. With this prototype, I will add a "Customize" feature that will give users the ability to filter the homepage to see topics that they are interested in. By doing so, the website's organization will improve and users will be able to personalize their news feed to find desired content.
<br><br>

**Purpose and Process**<br>
The purpose of creating the prototype of this project is to understand how my proposed features can fit within the existing product and its design system. To create the prototypes, I first took a screenshot of the website screen and used Figma to recreate it with the same fonts and colors. Then, I added my feature on top of the designs in a way that makes it natural within the system. I looked at the website for design styles, such as font size, color, and weight, as well as drop shadows, button types, corner radiuses, etc. 
<br><br>

## Tasks
My interactive prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Clicking the "Customize" button.
2. Choosing desired settings.
3. Clicking "Apply".
4. Viewing the new screen with customized settings.
<br><br>

**Color Variations** (for screen #4 labeled "Desktop-4")<br>
<em>The color variations below are as follows: Variation 1- light mode, Variation 2- dark mode on the added feature (the "World" and "US" news sections), Variation 3- hue variation, and Variation 4- dark mode on the whole screen.</em> <br><br>

Summary of findings: <br>
The impression test with my classmates today went well! They were really kind with their comments. The main findings that I took from this activity was that (1) the organization of the content fits within the existing CNN design system, and that (2) I could look into expanding the "Customize" feature and adding more filter options (like dates). Overall, the impression test was a great experience! <br><br>

## Design System

Description: <br>
For the color scheme, I decided to stick with CNN's existing brand colors of red, black, and gray. Though I tried out a green variation (I tried green because it is opposite of red on the color wheel), I thought that it looked out of place and didn't fit the vibe of the brand. After eye-dropping the colors on the existing CNN website, I noticed that they actually use two different shades of red — one darker, for their logo and other design elements (like the red circle next to the "LIVE TV" and the background box on the "LIVE UPDATES" label on the first picture), and one brighter, for text. I checked the color contrast for each color. As for the feature I designed, I did so while taking into consideration existing design rules on the website. For example, I made sure the drop shadow and the cornor radius on the dropdown that I designed matched the existing one on the website.

## Interactive Prototype
Here is the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/p1gaHYkho81C894hVpk6tl/DH-110?node-id=29%3A2">link</a> to the prototype. There are two features that I designed and prototyped; the prototype starts at the first feature. To view the prototype of the second feature, click anywhere on the last screen of the first feature or click on the profile icon at any point.

My interactive prototype supports the following tasks: <br>
**Feature 1:**
1. Clicking the "Customize" button.
2. Choosing desired settings.
3. Clicking "Apply".
4. Viewing the new screen with customized settings.

**Feature 2:**
1. Clicking the profile icon.
2. Clicking on "Settings".
3. Toggling ON Accessibility Mode.
4. Returning to the homepage through the CNN logo on the navigation bar.

Here are two gifs that demonstrate each prototype: <br>

## Cognitive Walkthrough
Below are questions that I asked and the answers I received from my classmates. <br>

_Feature 1_ <br>
**1. Can you tell what the "Customize" button does?** <br>
From MELKOTE, ADITI to Everyone: (3:59 PM) <br>
 I think I’d probably have to click on it and see what comes up in the drop down menu  <br>
From DONG, EMILY to Everyone: (4:00 PM) <br>
 I would say I wouldn't know what its customizing atfirst, but if I try it once I would know what it is  <br>
From HSIEH, JOY to Everyone: (4:00 PM) <br>
 i think now that you’ve explained it, it’s clear but i usually wouldn’t think that a new site is customizable so i dont know that i would pay the button any attention but the concept is cool!  <br>
From MA, JOYCE to Everyone: (4:00 PM) <br>
 I think it’s pretty intuitive since a lot of websites have options to filter now  <br><br>
 
**2. After I clicked on the "Customize" button, what are your thoughts?** <br>
From MELKOTE, ADITI to Everyone: (4:00 PM) <br>
 once you clicked on it it’s clear what it does!  <br>
From DONG, EMILY to Everyone: (4:01 PM) <br>
 hmm I think it would be more like filtering? I think customize sounds more like youre making the display look a certain way  <br>
From HSIEH, JOY to Everyone: (4:01 PM) <br>
 ^^ agreed! it reminds me of like shopping sites with filters ohhh yeah “filter” might be better  <br><br>

**3. What do you think about the overall flow?** <br>
From MELKOTE, ADITI to Everyone: (4:04 PM) <br>
 I think overall it’s very clear and easy to use!  <br>
 
_Feature 2_ <br>
**1. Is it intuitive getting from profile icon to settings?** <br>
From DONG, EMILY to Everyone: (4:06 PM) <br>
 ohh i thought settings would be under the hamburger menu sorry if its just me LOL  <br>
i think you can add a description for what accessibility mode is? <br>
From DONG, EMILY to Everyone: (4:07 PM) <br>
 cuz i would love that tbh <br>

**2. What do you think about the overall flow?** <br>
From HSIEH, JOY to Everyone: (4:09 PM) <br>
 ohhh yeah and hmm i think you could have accessibility mode on the account page and under the hamburger menu, but on the account page you set your default and hamburger menu is a quick toggle (helpful if multiple users sharing a device) <br><br>

_Findings Summary_ <br>
From the cognitive walkthrough, I found that while my prototype's flow was intuitive, there are some changes that could be made to make it clearer. For example, the word "Customize" may not be the best word to describe what the feature offers. Furthermore, I learned that it could be helpful to incorporate the Accessibility Mode on the homescreen as well as in the Settings, in case a user wants to quickly toggle between Accessibility Mode ON and OFF.

## Reflection

_(Reflection on creating the prototype)_
To create the prototype, I put myself in the shoes of the users and considered the steps that they would take when completing the tasks. This also helped me to prevent dead ends or any confusing interactions. The process of creating the prototype was smooth, but tedious in that I had to manually recreate all of the article titles and subtitles, as well as other design elements in order to customize the screens for the user.

_(Reflection on Cognitive Walkthrough)_
The cognitive walkthrough went really well! My classmates gave me valuable feedback while I walked through my prototypes. Based on the feedback that I got, I would change the "Customize" text to something else that better reflects the function. For example, the word "Filter" could serve a better purpose. Furthermore, I would consider placing the Accessibility Mode somewhere on the homescreen as well as in Settings, which would help users who don't have a CNN account to still use the feature.
